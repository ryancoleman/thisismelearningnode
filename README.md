seriously, this is just me screwing around. expect nothing.


project ideas: 

1. protein surface viewer, takes pdb files, does backend stuff (a bit slow), sends a surface back that can be rotated/viewed, etc
2. xml -> html renderer that reads PloS xml formatted articles, shows the first bit, then asks a question after each section to see if the reader read it before allowing access to the next bit. useful for teaching & reviewing
3.
